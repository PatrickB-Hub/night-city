## Installing

After you have forked the project and downloaded the code, install the necessary dependencies using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started).

To install the packages through npm, run the command `npm install`

To install the packages through yarn, run the command `yarn add`

NOTE: In the rest of the documentation, you will come across npm being used for running commands. To use yarn in place of npm for the commands, simply substitute npm for yarn. Example, npm start as yarn start. For more help, checkout [migrating from npm](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/migrating-from-npm/).
